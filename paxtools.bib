  abstract = {The identification of genes involved in health and disease remains
	a challenge. We describe a bioinformatics approach, together with
	a freely accessible, interactive and flexible software termed Endeavour,
	to prioritize candidate genes underlying biological processes or
	diseases, based on their similarity to known genes involved in these
	phenomena. Unlike previous approaches, ours generates distinct prioritizations
	for multiple heterogeneous data sources, which are then integrated,
	or fused, into a global ranking using order statistics. In addition,
	it offers the flexibility of including additional data sources. Validation
	of our approach revealed it was able to efficiently prioritize 627
	genes in disease data sets and 76 genes in biological pathway sets,
	identify candidates of 16 mono- or polygenic diseases, and discover
	regulatory genes of myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, the approach
	identified a novel gene involved in craniofacial development from
	a 2-Mb chromosomal region, deleted in some patients with DiGeorge-like
	birth defects. The approach described here offers an alternative
	integrative method for gene discovery.},

  abstract = {Although individual tumors of the same clinical type have surprisingly
	diverse genomic alterations, these events tend to occur in a limited
	number of pathways, and alterations that affect the same pathway
	tend to not co-occur in the same patient. While pathway analysis
	has been a powerful tool in cancer genomics, our knowledge of oncogenic
	pathway modules is incomplete. To systematically identify such modules,
	we have developed a novel method, Mutual Exclusivity Modules in cancer
	(MEMo). The method uses correlation analysis and statistical tests
	to identify network modules by three criteria: (1) Member genes are
	recurrently altered across a set of tumor samples; (2) member genes
	are known to or are likely to participate in the same biological
	process; and (3) alteration events within the modules are mutually
	exclusive. Applied to data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the
	method identifies the principal known altered modules in glioblastoma
	(GBM) and highlights the striking mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations
	in the PI(3)K, p53, and Rb pathways. In serous ovarian cancer, we
	make the novel observation that inactivation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is
	mutually exclusive of amplification of CCNE1 and inactivation of
	RB1, suggesting distinct alternative causes of genomic instability
	in this cancer type; and, we identify RBBP8 as a candidate oncogene
	involved in Rb-mediated cell cycle control. When applied to any cancer
	genomics data set, the algorithm can nominate oncogenic alterations
	that have a particularly strong selective effect and may also be
	useful in the design of therapeutic combinations in cases where mutual
	exclusivity reflects synthetic lethality.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Understanding the information-processing capabilities
	of signal transduction networks, how those networks are disrupted
	in disease, and rationally designing therapies to manipulate diseased
	states require systematic and accurate reconstruction of network
	topology. Data on networks central to human physiology, such as the
	inflammatory signalling networks analyzed here, are found in a multiplicity
	of on-line resources of pathway and interactome databases (Cancer
	CellMap, GeneGo, KEGG, NCI-Pathway Interactome Database (NCI-PID),
	PANTHER, Reactome, I2D, and STRING). We sought to determine whether
	these databases contain overlapping information and whether they
	can be used to construct high reliability prior knowledge networks
	for subsequent modeling of experimental data. RESULTS: We have assembled
	an ensemble network from multiple on-line sources representing a
	significant portion of all machine-readable and reconcilable human
	knowledge on proteins and protein interactions involved in inflammation.
	This ensemble network has many features expected of complex signalling
	networks assembled from high-throughput data: a power law distribution
	of both node degree and edge annotations, and topological features
	of a "bow tie" architecture in which diverse pathways converge on
	a highly conserved set of enzymatic cascades focused around PI3K/AKT,
	MAPK/ERK, JAK/STAT, NFkappaB, and apoptotic signaling. Individual
	pathways exhibit "fuzzy" modularity that is statistically significant
	but still involving a majority of "cross-talk" interactions. However,
	we find that the most widely used pathway databases are highly inconsistent
	with respect to the actual constituents and interactions in this
	network. Using a set of growth factor signalling networks as examples,
	we find a multiplicity of network topologies in which receptors couple
	to downstream components through myriad alternate paths. Many of
	these paths are inconsistent with well-established mechanistic features
	of signalling networks, such as a requirement for a transmembrane
	receptor in sensing extracellular ligands. CONCLUSIONS: Wide inconsistencies
	among interaction databases, pathway annotations, and the numbers
	and identities of nodes associated with a given pathway pose a major
	challenge for deriving causal and mechanistic insight from network
	graphs. We speculate that these inconsistencies are at least partially
	attributable to cell, and context-specificity of cellular signal
	transduction, which is largely unaccounted for in available databases,
	but the absence of standardized vocabularies is an additional confounding
	factor. As a result of discrepant annotations, it is very difficult
	to identify biologically meaningful pathways from interactome networks
	a priori. However, by incorporating prior knowledge, it is possible
	to successively build out network complexity with high confidence
	from a simple linear signal transduction scaffold. Such reduced complexity
	networks appear suitable for use in mechanistic models while being
	richer and better justified than the simple linear pathways usually
	depicted in diagrams of signal transduction.},

	There are two types of insights that may be obtained by graph theory

	results from multivariate experiments, such as microarray data sets,
	in the context of known pathways and networks to infer regulation.
	Using graph analyses, biochemical networks are found to be scale-free
	and small-world, indicating that these networks contain hubs, which
	are proteins that interact with many other molecules. These hubs
	may interact with many different types of proteins at the same time
	and location or at different times and locations, resulting in diverse
	biological responses. Groups of components in networks are organized
	in recurring patterns termed network motifs such as feedback and
	feed-forward loops. Graph analysis revealed that negative feedback
	loops are less common and are present mostly in proximity to the
	membrane, whereas positive feedback loops are highly nested in an
	architecture that promotes dynamical stability. Cell signaling networks
	have multiple pathways from some input receptors and few from others.
	Such topology is reminiscent of a classification system. Signaling
	networks display a bow-tie structure indicative of funneling information

	networks is the systematic organization and integration of complex
	interactions taking place within various biological pathways. Currently,
	the information of the biological pathways is dispersed in multiple
	databases in various formats. hiPathDB is an integrated pathway database
	that combines the curated human pathway data of NCI-Nature PID, Reactome,
	BioCarta and KEGG. In total, it includes 1661 pathways consisting
	of 8976 distinct physical entities. hiPathDB provides two different
	types of integration. The pathway-level integration, conceptually
	a simple collection of individual pathways, was achieved by devising
	an elaborate model that takes distinct features of four databases
	into account and subsequently reformatting all pathways in accordance
	with our model. The entity-level integration creates a single unified
	pathway that encompasses all pathways by merging common components.
	Even though the detailed molecular-level information such as complex
	formation or post-translational modifications tends to be lost, such
	integration makes it possible to investigate signaling network over
	the entire pathways and allows identification of pathway cross-talks.
	Another strong merit of hiPathDB is the built-in pathway visualization
	module that supports explorative studies of complex networks in an
	interactive fashion. The layout algorithm is optimized for virtually
	automatic visualization of the pathways. hiPathDB is available at

Using GEM, we correctly predicted a significant number of androgen receptor modulators and observed that most modulators can both act as co-activators and co-repressors for different target genes.},

@article{TCGA2008,
abstract = {Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas--the most common type of adult brain cancer--and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer.},

Ironically, despite having one of the highest ratios of graphical to textual information, biology still lacks standard graphical notations. The recent deluge of biological knowledge makes addressing this deficit a pressing concern. Toward this goal, we present the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN), a visual language developed by a community of biochemists, modelers and computer scientists. SBGN consists of three complementary languages: process diagram, entity relationship diagram and activity flow diagram. Together they enable scientists to represent networks of biochemical interactions in a standard, unambiguous way. We believe that SBGN will foster efficient and accurate representation, visualization, storage, exchange and reuse of information on all kinds of biological knowledge, from gene regulation, to metabolism, to cellular signaling.},

The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},
